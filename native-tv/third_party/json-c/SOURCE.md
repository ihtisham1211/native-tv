The webOSbrew SDK provides json-c 0.16. TV builds link its static archive so
the service does not require a particular system json-c SONAME. Host builds
use the installed json-c development package. The C source is not vendored.

The notice below is copied into generated runtime and client packages. It is
the upstream COPYING notice from tag json-c-0.16-20220414:
